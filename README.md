## About Us
We are a group of enthusiastic geeks currently studying in the "German University in Cairo" working toward a degree in Computer Science and Engineering major. We have special interest in Security, Embedded Systems and Web Application Technologies.

## About the project
The Project was designed as a course requirement as part of the “Database I” course. The aim was to get hands-on the life cycle of designing a data base from scratch. Starting by an EERD then translating it to a relational Scheme. Finally, coding the whole scheme as well as required functionalities of the system in Microsoft SQL Server. The project target was to build an online shopping system that has multiple kinds of users (Customers , Admins, Delivery People and Vendors). The Description offered as well as the required functionalities can be found in the files of this project. The project was based on a waterfall model. We first designed the EERD and the relational scheme. Then we were provided with a feed back. The was followed by the SQL Implementation based on dividing the system to procedures and views. Finally, the system was thoroughly tested for functional and security issues to make sure it is robust enough for implementation. 

### Notes

The Project is a small simulation lacking many  features and to be applicable to run in a real world environment will need some amendments and change in design. The main aim was to boost the skills of the team in designing, implementing and testing database systems which was reflected as the whole system was successfully completed and whole team got a grade of A+ in the course reflecting the fulfillments of the system requirements.
